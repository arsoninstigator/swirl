        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Code & Cipher is an after-school program and a girls-in-tech initiative based in New Delhi, India (operating virtually as well) dedicated to introducing young women (middle school aged girls in particular) to the exciting world of technology. We help financially underprivileged girls from government schools write their first line of code and nudge them in the direction of STEM. 
            <br />
            Code & Cipher is also affiliated with organizations such as <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a> and <a href="https://girlswhocode.com">Girls Who Code</a>.
            <br /> <br />
            Code & Cipher is committed to fostering the next generation of tech leaders through workshops, events, and collaborative learning. We provide a platform for young girls of all backgrounds to engage with technology in a supportive and innovative environment. This is done by running coding workshops, building projects together, inviting mentors, asking questions and a whole lot of trial and error.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We feel like coding is a superpower and believe in the power of technology to change lives. Our mission is to educate, inspire, and empower young girls of all backgrounds to pursue careers in technology and digital literacy.  </p>


        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
