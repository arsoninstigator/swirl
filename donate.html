        <h2>Support Code & Cipher</h2>
        <p> Since we're a small program without any backing from big tech companies, we're often stuck with paying the costs associated with running Code & Cipher out of our own pockets. Your donation helps us provide tech education, organize events, and foster an inclusive tech community. 
            <br /><br />
        Weâ€™re always looking for funding, sponsorship and generous donations, be it monetary or in-kind, and have the provision of making your <a>contribution completely tax-deductible</a> if located within the US. Some examples of what could be donated in case of in-kind sponsorships includes: <br />
        - hardware components <br />
        - discarded technology <br />
        - electronics kits <br />
        - spare laptops, chromebooks or other working devices <br />
        - discounts for certain subscriptions or gift cards <br /> 
        Your contribution, no matter how big or small, would truly mean a lot to us, make real change and help those who we serve. 
        <br /> <br />
        We would love for those in the tech industry to donate your time to sit down for an ask-me-anything session to give us an idea of what itâ€™s like applying to entry-level roles in this job market, the interview process, getting hired and navigating life as an IT professional (especially in India).
